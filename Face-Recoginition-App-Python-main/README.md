# Face-Recoginition-App-Python
A very simple Face Recognition App is made using Python.
It uses our laptop/desktop camera to identify each and every individual correctly.
Also an excel sheet has been made where the faces detected by the AI will be listed and also the time at which the face was detected.
One needs to install the following libraries in the system given in requiremnets.txt
And one needs to store any person's pics and rename them in the format "person name.jpg"
Then simply run FaceRecProject.py to get the desired output i.e. the Face Recognition App
